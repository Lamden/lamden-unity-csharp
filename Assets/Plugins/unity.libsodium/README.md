unity.libsodium
===============


based version : `1.0.10` | windows/linux : `1.0.16`

# What's this?

 I decided that there should be a simpler way and I created **unity.libsodium**, a plugin that helps you to use [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/) in your Unity3d projects in a clear and easy way and works in **iOS, Android, OSX, Windows, Android** projects.


# The fast track
 All you have to do to start using it in your project:

1. [Download this .unitypackage](https://github.com/netpyoung/unity.libsodium/raw/master/libsodium-0.0.1.unitypackage), extract its content on your Unity3D Project. It contains the dlls that Unity3d will need to access libsodium.
4. **Youâ€™re done!**

# Example

``` csharp
		var x = NativeLibsodium.sodium_init ();
		Debug.Log (x);


		const string MESSAGE = "Test message to encrypt";
		var nonce = StreamEncryption.GenerateNonceChaCha20();
		var key = StreamEncryption.GenerateKey();

		//encrypt it
		var encrypted = StreamEncryption.EncryptChaCha20(MESSAGE, nonce, key);


		//decrypt it
		var decrypted = StreamEncryption.DecryptChaCha20(encrypted, nonce, key);

		Debug.Log (MESSAGE);
		Debug.Log (Encoding.UTF8.GetString(encrypted));
		Debug.Log (Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decrypted));
```
